# Space Shooter #

This game is a work in progress 3D simulation of space invaders.

## Features ##

### 3D Models and Movement ###

Player can move up and down, and left and right on their screens. This allows the character to dodge asteroids (and eventually enemy projectiles).
This promotes more interactive gaming than just dodging left to right.

### 3D Laser that can be aimed ###

While you are flying your space ship, you can use spacebar to fire a laser. This laser aims in the diretion of your mouse so you can shoot enemies
that are not directly in front of your ship

### Asteroid obstacles ###

I created a game controller to randomly generate asteroids that will move towards the player. If the rigid-body hits the player, both the player and 
the asteroid will explode, ending the game.

### Music and Animations ###

Music and animations of lasers, models, and flying have all been implemented.
